## Set up a portfolio website project

In this project, you will set up a mobile version of a portfolio website. To begin, go to [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=0%3A1) and select a [template](https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=0%3A1).

### General requirements
* Create a Github repository.
* Set up the repository locally by cloning it to your local machine.
* Create a feature branch.
* Configure the upstream remote value.
* Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
* Make sure that you used correct [GitHub Flow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/github_flow.md).
* Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).
* The 2 sections you need to build for this project are:
   1. The toolbar (or header)
   2. The headline section (right after the header)
* In order to lay out the elements on the page you should use Flexbox in all 2 sections.
* You don't need to implement any functionality that requires JavaScript, like opening the menu or creating dropdowns.
* You must stick to the design as much as possible (e.g. font, colors, images, tests, margins) using the [templates in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=0%3A1).
* Implement the button interactions (enable, hover, etc.).
